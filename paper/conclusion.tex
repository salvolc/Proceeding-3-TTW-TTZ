\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conclusion}

Measurements of the production cross sections of a top-quark pair in
association with a $Z$ or $W$ boson using \lumi of data collected by the ATLAS
detector in $\sqrt{s} = 13\,\TeV$ $pp$ collisions at the LHC are presented. 
Final states with either two same-charge muons, or three or four leptons
are analysed.  From a simultaneous fit to nine signal regions and two control regions, the
\ttZ and \ttW production cross sections are determined to be $\sttZ = 0.9 \pm
0.3$ pb and $\sttW = 1.5 \pm 0.8$ pb. 
Both measurements are consistent with the NLO
QCD theoretical calculations, $\sttZ = 0.84 \pm 0.09\,\text{pb}$ and $\sttW =
0.60 \pm 0.08\,\text{pb}$.
