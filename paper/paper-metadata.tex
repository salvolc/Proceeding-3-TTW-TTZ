\AtlasAbstract{A measurement of the $t\bar{t}Z$ and $t\bar{t}W$ production
cross sections in final states with either two same-charge muons, or three or four
leptons (electrons or muons) is presented.  The analysis uses a data sample of
proton--proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ Te\kern -0.1em V recorded with the
ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015, corresponding to a total
integrated luminosity of \mbox{3.2 fb$^{-1}$}.  The inclusive cross sections
are extracted using likelihood fits to signal and control regions, resulting in
$\sigma_{t\bar{t}Z} = 0.9 \pm 0.3$ pb and $\sigma_{t\bar{t}W} = 1.5 \pm 0.8$ pb,
in agreement with the Standard Model predictions.}
